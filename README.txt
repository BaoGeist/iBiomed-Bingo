This is a Bingo creation randomizer/creation app created as means to provide participating iBiomeds to play a custom Bingo during specific classes with a to-be-left-unnamed professor.

The list of possible BINGO texts can be changed by adding to or removing from the "cards.txt" file. Ensure that there is no empty line in this file.

Have a nice day, and don't forget, 'gud slide'!
